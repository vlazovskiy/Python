Problem: Given a string s consisting of small English letters, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return '_'. Write a solution that only iterates over the string once and uses O(1) additional memory, since this is what you would be asked to do during a real interview.

Note: the solution has two similar tracking 'sets': unique_chars_list and unique_chars_set. That's because list lookups take O(n) time, while set lookups are amortized O(1) time. Even though the original problem deals with lower case English letters (n = 26), thos solution would generalize better if the number of characters was much larger.

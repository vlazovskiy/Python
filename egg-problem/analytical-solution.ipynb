If the $k^{th}$ floor is above, we will have fewer tries: we can throw the first egg again from floor 75 and look at the result, which means we would have to either test the second egg between floors 51-74 or throw the first egg again (if it didn't break) from floor 87. In any case, the worst case scenraio is still 1 attempt at floor 50 + 49 attemps from the floors between 1-49 inclusive. That's 50 in total."

That's 10 attempts in total. Now, in the worst case scenario, if the $k^{th}$ floor is 99, the first egg won't break until we throw it from floor 100. By then we will have already made 10 attemps.

    "**#5.** One of the ways to ensure that the intervals add up nicely to 100 is to pick intervals of different lengths. Picking interval lengths at random is too confusing, so what if we look at intervals of consecutive lengths, like $x$, $x-1$, $x-2$, $x-3$. Then, perhaps, there is a number x such that:\n",

If the egg doesn't break, then we throw the first egg again from floor $x+(x-1) = 2x - 1$, and the second egg will beed to be thrown between floors $(2x-1)$ and $(x+1)$, meaning we will have to throw egg two $(2x-1)-(x+1)= x-2$ times. If the first egg doesn't break first two times, we will throw it from $x + (x-1) + (x-2) = 3x - 3$ floor, and the second egg will need to be thrown between floors $2x-1$ and $3x-3$, so we will be making $3x-3 - (2x-1) = x - 2$ attenps. So the more times we need to throw the first egg, the fewer times we will have to throw the second egg. In other words, the number of total attemps will be constant.\n",
